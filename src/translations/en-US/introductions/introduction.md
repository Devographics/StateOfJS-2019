<span class="first-letter">W</span>e were pretty sure 2018 would be the last time we did this survey. After all, the JavaScript ecosystem can’t very well keep changing *again*, can it?

But what do you know, turns out JavaScript isn’t quite done changing just yet! And so we had to dig up our components and charts, curse us-from-a-year-ago for writing such crappy code, and get to work. 

We had some help though. The amazing [Amelia Wattenberger](http://wattenberger.com/) joined the team as a guest dataviz expert to contribute a fresh new look on our data, and you’ll be able to explore her work in the **Overview** section.

We also borrowed a couple new visualisations from the State of JS's sister survey, the [State of CSS](https://2019.stateofcss.com/). We recommend checking it out if you haven’t done so yet!

### Team

The State of JavaScript Survey is created and maintained by:

- [Sacha Greif](https://twitter.com/sachagreif) (me!): Design, writing, coding
- [Raphaël Benitte](https://twitter.com/benitteraphael): Data analysis, data visualizations

Be sure to check out my React/GraphQL JavaScript framework, [Vulcan.js](http://vulcanjs.org), as well as Raphaël's React data visualization library [nivo](https://nivo.rocks).

### Download Our Data

You can [download the raw JSON data for this survey](https://www.kaggle.com/sachag/state-of-js-2019). Let us know if you end up making your own data visualizations!

### Completion Percentages

Because all survey questions could be skipped, some questions ended up with fewer answers than others. So we've added a small pie chart indicator to each question to let you know which proportion of total respondents answered it.  

### Credits & Stuff

The site is set in IBM Plex Mono. Questions? Feedback? [Get in touch!](mailto:hello@stateofjs.com)

And now, let's see what CSS has been up to this year!
