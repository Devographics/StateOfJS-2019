<span class="first-letter">W</span>e were pretty sure 2018 would be the last time we did this survey. After all, the JavaScript ecosystem can’t very well keep changing *again*, can it?

But what do you know, turns out JavaScript isn’t quite done changing just yet! And so after over 21,717 respondents took this year's survey we had to dig up our components and charts, curse us-from-a-year-ago for writing such crappy code, and get to work digging through the data. 

We had some help though. The amazing [Amelia Wattenberger](http://wattenberger.com/) joined the team as a guest dataviz expert to contribute a fresh new look on our data, and you’ll be able to explore her work in the **Overview** section.

We also borrowed a couple new visualisations from the State of JS's sister survey, the [State of CSS](https://2019.stateofcss.com/). We recommend checking it out if you haven’t done so yet!

### Team

The State of JavaScript Survey is created and maintained by:

- [Sacha Greif](https://twitter.com/sachagreif) (me!): Design, writing, coding
- [Raphaël Benitte](https://twitter.com/benitteraphael): Data analysis, data visualizations

Be sure to check out my React/GraphQL JavaScript framework, [Vulcan.js](http://vulcanjs.org), as well as Raphaël's React data visualization library [nivo](https://nivo.rocks).

### Download Our Data

You can [download the raw JSON data for this survey](https://www.kaggle.com/sachag/state-of-js-2019). Let us know if you end up making your own data visualizations!

### Completion Percentages

Because all survey questions could be skipped, some questions ended up with fewer answers than others. So we've added a small pie chart indicator to each question to let you know which proportion of total respondents answered it.  

### Credits & Stuff

The site is set in IBM Plex Mono. Questions? Feedback? [Get in touch!](mailto:hello@stateofjs.com)

And now, let's see what JavaScript has been up to this year!
