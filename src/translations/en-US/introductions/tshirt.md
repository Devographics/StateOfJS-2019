## Support the survey and look good in the process!

This year we're releasing our very own **🎈🎉👕 State of JavaScript T-shirt 👕🎉🎈** to finance our efforts!

The shirt features a ”periodic table of JavaScript” that lists the most popular libraries grouped by category, along with their GitHub stars counts (in thousands).

This shirt is a great way to familiarize yourself with the JavaScript ecosystem, and maybe even strike up a conversation with other like-minded JavaScript developers!
