## Support the survey and look good in the process!

This year we're trying something new to finance our efforts: we're releasing our very own **🎈🎉👕 State of JavaScript T-shirt 👕🎉🎈**!

The shirt features a ”periodic table of JavaScript” that lists the most popular libraries grouped by category, along with their GitHub stars counts (in thousands).

So whether you're going to a conference, a job interview, or just work, this shirt is a great way to strike up conversation with other like-minded JavaScript developers!
